#angular-wakanda-front

If you want to directly use the angular-wakanda-connector : [get it here](master/app/scripts/services/angular-wakanda-connector).

Scaffolded with yeoman angular generator in order to follow the yeoman+grunt+bower workflow.

###Included :

A wakanda solution on which the tests are based is included in `WakandaBaseSolution/Contacts`, launch it with Wakanda Server before `grunt serve` (see bellow).

###Needed (only for the development of the connector) :

* node
* yeoman : `npm install yo -g` (optional this was used to scaffold the project)
* bower `npm install bower -g` (shipped with yeoman)
* grunt `npm install grunt-cli -g` (shipped with yeoman)
* grunt `npm karma -g` (for unit tests) **optional now, since we switched to e2e tests**

You may have to execute those commands with `sudo`

For unit tests (end-to-end) :

* `npm install protractor -g` will install the e2e test runner
* `webdriver-manager update`
* If this doesn't work, look at the log, you should see something like this :
<pre>
Updating selenium standalone
downloading http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.42/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.0.jar...
Updating chromedriver
downloading https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.10/chromedriver_mac32.zipâ€¦
</pre>
* This may be because of some kind of firewall or proxy problem (see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/selenium-users/aIIqHBnB_Is/7ws4xCQ84yQJ)), so :
	* direct download both the files (check the urls above) :
		* http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.42/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.0.jar
		* https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.10/chromedriver_mac32.zip
	* copy them into the node_modules dependency : 
		* `sudo cp /Users/Rosset/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.0.jar /usr/lib/node_modules/protractor/selenium/selenium-server-standalone-2.42.0.jar`
		* `sudo cp /Users/Rosset/Downloads/chromedriver_mac32.zip /usr/lib/node_modules/protractor/selenium/chromedriver_mac32.zip`
		* `cd /usr/lib/node_modules/protractor/selenium/`
		* `unzip chromedriver_mac32.zip`
	* finally : `webdriver-manager update`


###Init

Once you have all above, to init :

* `npm install` (install the local dependencies)
* `bower install` (install the frontend dependencies)
* `grunt initConfig` (duplicate `wakandaApp.default.json` to wakandaApp.json), **then customize your own settings**
* Go to `app/scripts/services/angular-wakanda-connector` and `npm install` (for this moment, this is necessary for development purposes, more in `app/scripts/services/angular-wakanda-connector/README.md`)

###Grunt tasks :

* **To test (will launch a test server)** : `grunt serve` (will launch your app in livereload mode)
* To test in build mode (will build AND launch a server) : `grunt serve:dist` 
* To build only : `grunt build` (your build is in `dist` folder)
* To copy your build to your Wakanda Project folder :
    * first run `grunt build`
    * then run `grunt wakCopyBuild` (warning, before copying, it cleans up the WebFolder so be sure of what you set in `wakandaApp.json`)
* You can also copy the sources to your wakanda server webfolder by : `grunt wakCopy`
    
###Tests (end to end)

The tests are end to end tests, not unit tests, since we have statefull tests with the db+REST.

* To launch the tests : 
	* your wakanda server (which is described in `wakandaApp.json`) must be running. It exposes handlers that will reset the database.
	* your node server should be running (the tests on the front are made through it)
* To launch the tests, just type : `npm run e2e-test` or `npm run test` (those are aliases)

Changes in the Gruntfile.js :

In order to get the REST API, I had to proxy the /rest/* request via grunt-connect-proxy.
Here are the following modifications made to the original yeoman Gruntfile :

* a `proxyMiddleware` is applied to the different connect tasks
* a wakandaApp attribute, containing infos about your wakanda app server was added to the yeoman attribute in the grunt config (from `wakandaApp.json` file)
* for each connect task, a `configureProxies:target` task was added
* added the wakWebFolder target in clean and copy tasks, to be able to transfer your built project to your wakanda WebFolder, just by doing `grunt wakCopyBuild` (expect to have to add --force, I left this warning because it empties the WebFolder before copying the build)
* added watch tasks to rebuild the connector into a closured file with sourcemaps (see more in `app/scripts/services/angular-wakanda-connector/README.md`)
* disabled jsTest in the watch task (since we use e2e tests)
